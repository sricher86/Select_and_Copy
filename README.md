# Select_and_Copy
Python mini-application that selects files based on CSV data. Using tkinter for user interface, I created this application for myself as I do not use Lightroom. The application allows the user to load a CSV, choose a destination folder, and a source folder. The program parses the CSV file and compares each filename to those in the destination folder, and each time it finds a matching file, it copies said file and pastes it into the source folder.
